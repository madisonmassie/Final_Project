# Breaking the Glass Ceiling: Looking at Glass Type Classification
## Final Project, Launchcode Women+ Fall 2021 Cohort

### Collaborators:

Nasiba Adilova, Heather Leighton-Dick, Madison Massie


## Overview
Glass is a fascinating substance: a solid material with the molecular structure of a liquid. Glass occurs naturally in the world, usually as the byproduct of a natural phenomenon like molten lava or a lightning or meteor strike. Humans have been making glass since about 3600 BC, and initially used it for decoration and food storage/serving. Today, glass is used around the world in many different chemical variations and in many different industries (medicine, technology, crime scene forensics, and construction, to name a few). The word glass mostly refers to materials that are at least 70% silicate, but the presence or absence of other materials such as barium, iron, calcium, and sodium create different types, or classes, of glass which share physical properties.

## Project Description
  Our objective was to create and compare models that could be used to predict a glass's type

Heather – SVM (Linear, RBF, Polynomial)

RESULT: 3 people with same dataset

## Conclusions
  some of the challenges you faced
  what would you add/change/enhance in the future?
  Conclusions:
Which model performed the best overall? Based on accuracy score
Why might that be? ???
Why is glass important to study?  Medical applications, technology,

SQL Queries:
What is the most common chemical element in glass?
Which element is the least common?
Is there an element present that doesn’t change a glass sample’s type?
Which model performed best when comparing observed type to predicted type?

Lessons Learned: --data doesn’t have any examples of Type 4 (found out half-way through)
